#### This is my experience with the tasks to join Amfoss

The tasks start off by requiring candidates to install Ubuntu, an open source operating system, which not only fits the theme of the club, but I also feel it liberates one from proprietary software at a fundamental level.
&nbsp;

The first few tasks were quite simple, except for the programming task, which had questions ranging from easy to hard depending on how experienced you are.
&nbsp;

Each task was accompanied by at least enough documentation/resources to get the barebones knowledge to work with the related technology used to solve the task.
&nbsp;

All tasks after the fifth one requires a respectable amount of thought to complete. They also provide an enriching learning outcome if looked into in depth. I spent a lot more time looking up new things while attempting some tasks, and got diverted from the main goal multiple times. The exposure a beginner would receive is really great.
&nbsp;

This was definitely a positive experience for me!
