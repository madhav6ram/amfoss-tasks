## Q. Why must we choose you?

I am very interested to learn more about development and willing to contribute to FOSS. I also didnt find a lot of people sharing the same interests and so joining this club will be very impactful for me. This is great reason to choose me because when I do something I enjoy I try to give me best shot!

## Q. What is your plan for the next 6 months?

My plan for the coming months would be to improve my problem solving skills. I will also learn more about domains that have interested me like data science, low level computing etc. 

## Q. How would you contribute back to the club?

I feel like I have quite a lot of free time, at least thats how online mode feels like. I want to spend it productively, so personally I can help in any way possible, even open to learning new things ofcourse.

## Q. Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

It was near perfect. The programming tasks in task-03 could have been better formatted, so all the critical info is provided in the question. In some questions info was scattered in the input/output constraints. Other than that it was perfect and I had fun solving each task.
